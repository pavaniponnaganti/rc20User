  * @brief Call to register the subprotocol to Relay WebSockets Protocol
  *
  * Call this API to register a subprotocol to the Relay WebSockets Protocol. Once registered, a WebSockets communication
  * channel can be created by a remote client to use for sending and receiving the subprotocol messages.
  *
  * @param[in] name Specify the string name of the subprotocol. This name will be use to channel the request to the correct subprotocols and
  * must be unique. Remote client will use this name to connect the Websocket to this protocol. The name must be null terminated and will not be
  * freed by the webserver after using.
  * @param[in] rcvdCb This callback is called by the Relay WebSockets Protocol to forward received message to the subprotocol. If NULL, will use the
  * default handler (see rwspRcvdCbDef function).
  * @param[in] encCb This callback is called by the Relay WebSockets Protocol to encode the subprotocol message in JSON format before sending to
  * the remote client(s). If not specified, the default handler will be use (see rwspEncCb function).
  * @param[in] decCb This callback is called by the Relay WebSockets Protocol to convert the JSON message into the subprotocol message format.
  * If not specified, the default handler will be use (see rwspDecCbDef function).
  *
  * @return RwspError_Ok if no error occured
  * @return RwspError_Name if the specified subprotocol name already exists
